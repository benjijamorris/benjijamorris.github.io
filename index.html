          <h3>Boggle Player</h3>
          <h4>June 2020</h4>
          <p> While playing Boggle online with my family, we were joined by a superhuman boggle player. Inspired, I set out to create a Boggle Bot of my own. The bot uses Selenium to log in to an online Boggle site,
            sets up a solo game (didn't want to ruin other peoples' games), change some user-inputted settings, and begin a game. Prefixes are stored as a 4-tuple containing the x and y coordinates of a letter, a prefix ending at that position,
            and a list of the positions of letters used to spell that word. To prevent expanding prefixes that don't lead to any words, a trie is created from a version of the SCOWL dictionary to check prefixes quickly.
            As an extension, I also implemented a Convolutional Neural Network to get the letter layout of a boggle board providedin an image and then use the helper functions I created for theonlineboggle game to enumerate the words found in the picture.
            Using five screenshots of the web boggle player and image augmentation, I was able to achieve 98% validation accuracy and correctly call the layout of a few test boggle images. In the future, I hope to makethe CNN more robust
            to pictures of boggle boards not coming from website screenshots.

          <h3>Analysis of Flock Sensitivity Profiles</h3>
          <h4>Collaborators: Meghan Donohoe</h4>
          <h4>March 2020 - May 2020</h4>
          <p>The act of flocking can have great benefits in terms of predator evasion. Some researchers have shown a heterogeneity in the sensitivity of an agent’s response to a predator when being part of a flock.
             This project aims to understand if the variation in response is adaptive, or if there is an “ideal” response to predation. We created an agent-based model, simulating a flock with heterogeneous sensitivity to predators.
             Birds with high-sensitivity predator responses incurred an energy penalty proportional to their sensitivity that reduced their probability of reproduction. Convergence towards an ideal, desensitized profile was seen in
             the magnitude of the change in heading after detecting a predator, sensitivity to neighboring birds’ responses, and detection radius. In contrast, predator detection angle of vision and acceleration during an evasive
             response failed to converge, suggesting that variability within a flock in these dimensions aids flock survival. These results suggest that local information and a largely uniform, desensitized predator evasion profile
             are sufficient for flock survival under a significant energy penalty and energy-based reproduction.

          <h3>Identifying Vaccination-Amenable Populations</h3>
          <h4>Collaborators: Matthew Lawson</h4>
          <h4>November 2019 - December 2019</h4>
          <p>In order to preserve herd immunity, a phenomenon important for protecting individuals who cannot be vaccinated,
              a large percentage of the population must be vaccinated. However, it is often difficult to identify whether
              a population has low vaccination rates due to anti-vaccine sentiment or economic/logistical obstacles. Similarly,
              there is a dichotomy in outreach efficacy, so better identifying these populations can improve outreach resource allocation.
              Here, we combine household income and vaccination data from California and use a k-means clustering approach to identify
              amenable populations.

          <h3>ICESat-2 Cloud Removal</h3>
          <h4>Collaborators: Matthew Lawson</h4>
          <h4>October 2019 - December 2019</h4>
          <p>Photon return data from the ICESat-2 satellite is used for a variety of purposes such as tracking glacial activity and measuring
            rainforest canopy density. However, photon dispersion from clouds and daylight result in noisy data, making it difficult to identify
            relevant features. We used an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model approach to cluster and classify points as 'ground' or 'cloud' to aid
            downstream analysis of geographical features.

          <h4>October, 2019</h4>
          <p>Culmination of two years of independent research concerning inflammatory predictors of the depressive responses to exercise.
              Specifically, it was hypothesized that exercise alteration of a class of proteins called cytokines could impact rates of new
              neuron generation in the hippocampus (a brain region associated with depression and cognitive function) in a manner that
              influences depressive symtpoms. Further exploratory analyses involved examination of three single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytokine-related genes
              associated with depressive symptoms. Although the main hypotheses were not supported, several analyses that some alleles of the SNPs examined could
              protect against hippocampal atrophy in association with exercise.
